# check-tpay-wallet
Checks if you have been credited your TPAY tokens and sends you an email when done.


The program asks you for your email account & password (to be able to send out email), account(s) where you want to be notified, wallet(s) you want to check, and last but not least the time interval you would like the program to verify the wallet.

Open the terminal in Mac, or cmd in Windows & run python send_mail.py

Any comments are appreciated.

Enjoy!
